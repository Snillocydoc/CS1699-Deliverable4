# Property-Based and Combinatorial Testing of Tic Tac Toe

This repository includes property-based tests and combinatorial tests of a tic-tac-toe game written using the
functional programming paradigm.  The original can be found here:

Note: There were unit tests provided by the author to test some methods.  I deleted them in this repository
to avoid confusion over which tests were mine.  This is only for academic and grading purposes; there was nothing wrong 
with the original tests.
